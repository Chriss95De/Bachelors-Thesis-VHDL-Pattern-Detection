# Summary

This study work addresses the topic of image processing in an FPGA. Camera images are captured, stored, processed, and interpreted on an FPGA board to extract information from the image. This paper represents a further development based on an existing project, building upon pre-existing functionalities such as storing camera images and displaying them via VGA on a monitor. The objective was to review the current project status and utilize the existing functionalities to implement a two-dimensional object recognition system. Insights from a previous academic study were leveraged and expanded upon. Additionally, this paper aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of what already existed and how the different components function. The hardware description language "Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHDL)" was employed for the implementation, incorporating new modules that enable the determination of an object's position in a two-dimensional space.
